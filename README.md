- loader to get the core data
- lobby for the owner
- can not start game if < 2 players, disable the button (only visibile for the owner)
- when that is done, lobby state
- we can already show players in the lobby, write the code this is what i mean, that should be possible
- add sound effect manager - we got 4 sound effects
- add hardcoded data to generate cards with the 32 images that we have
- you can join someone else's room via join room dialog
